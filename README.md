## Maven Rail Challenge - Recreation 

This report was created as part of my commitment to continuous self-improvement.

After submitting my first report for the Maven Rail Challenge, I reviewed the work of other contestants. Some of their reports were truly admirable.

Inspired by their work, I decided to recreate my own report, incorporating new techniques that I observed from the other participants.
