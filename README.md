# Maven Rail Challenge - Recreation 

This report was created as part of my commitment to continuous self-improvement.

After submitting my first report for the Maven Rail Challenge, I reviewed the work of other contestants. Some of their reports were truly admirable.

Inspired by their work, I decided to recreate my own report, incorporating new techniques that I observed from the other participants.

## New techniques:
1. I added a white-filled shape behind all the visuals to create white space, giving them a cleaner look and better contrast with the background.
2. I created a line graph highlighting the Max and Min values by applying custom formatting.
3. I combined the line graph with a table focusing on financial aspects.

+ Dax used for the conditional formatting:

4. Leveraging the visual impact of white space, I created a cluster of two different visuals: a pie chart and a bar graph. This approach helps visualize the question of which ticket class and ticket type are most common in a cohesive unit.

5. I extracted the hour from the original Departure Time and formatted it in a 12-hour clock, adding AM or PM to indicate the part of the day.

6. Then I created an interactive bar graph and a matrix that, with the help of bookmarks, switch between AM and PM hours.

7. I created two overlapping visualizations and inserted related bookmarks to toggle between them.
